## Overview

This program asks the user to enter information for three music tracks, the album,
artist, title, and playtime. The program then finds the average play time and
the track with a play time closest to 3 minutes and outputs that information with 
a sorted list of the tracks.

## Reflection

This project had very repetitive portions, and the limitations against using arrays
and loops were annoying.
- What worked well and what was a struggle?
    Using methods to simplify the main method and increase readability
    was a good solution, and allowed me to repeat operations without
    rewriting the same code. I did not struggle with anything on this
    project.
- What concepts still aren't quite clear?
    I think I've got it!
- What techniques did you use to make your code easy to debug and modify?
    I used methods to reuse functionality without rewriting the same code.
- What would you change about your design process?
    I would use loops instead of all of the nested if statements. I
    would also add better error handling so that you cannot accidentally input
    a weird value for the playtime of a track.
- If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself about doing this project?
    I would say get Panda Express before starting.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac JukeboxHero.java
```
Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java JukeboxHero
```

You should then see prompts in the console for track information.

## Sources used

I did not use any outside sources for this project.
