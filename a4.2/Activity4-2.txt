DoubleComparison.java Questions

Look at the “Variables” section in the debugger panel.  What is the value of the result variable? What is the value of the expected variable? Why aren’t they the same?

  result is 0.09999999999999998, while expected is 0.10000000000000000. They aren't the same because of floating point inprecision. This is why we cannot directly compare them.

Does it go into the if-statement, or the else-statement? Why?

  It goes into the else-statement because the result variable is not equal to the expected variable due to floating point inprecision.

StringComparison.java Questions

What is the value (labeled “value”) of CODE_WORD? What is the id (number after @)?  What is the value of myWord? What is the id? 

  The value of CODE_WORD is byte[6]@22 and the id is 22. The value of myWord is byte[6]@22 and the id is 22.

Does it go into the if-statement block, or else block? Why?

  It goes into the if-statement block because the CODE_WORD variable and myWord variable are pointing to the same memory location.

What is the value of CODE_WORD? What is the id?  What is the value of input? What is the id?

  The value of CODE_WORD is byte[6]@22 and the id is 22. The value of input is byte[6]@30 and the id is 30.

Use the “Step over” icon to execute the next line of code. Does it go into the if-statement block, or else block? Why?

  It goes into the else-statement block because the input and CODE_WORD pointers are pointing to different memory locations.
