## Overview

The MineWalker Application provides a GUI with the functionality to play MineWalker.

## Reflection

Overall this project wasn't too difficult. There were some parts that were a bit
confusing, namely whether to use a JTextArea, JTextComponent, JLabel, or JTextField. 
Programming the classes and helper methods were pretty simple, and this project walked
me through pretty specifically so I don't even feel like there was much to do myself here... 

To debug, I just printed helpful messages to see which lines where running when and make
sure the values were correct. If I were to do this project again I would have read the
project guidelines a little closer, as it would have saved me some time.

## Compiling and Using

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Compile the code with `javac MineWalker.java`
